# Installing packages

Packages are publicly available collections of functions that have been written by users and developers for specific tasks. Most of the packages are available through CRAN and can be installed as follows:

```{r}
#install Liam Revell's "phytools" package
install.packages("phytools")
```

To use the functions contained within a package, you need to tell R to load the library

```
#load the phytools package
library(phytools)
```
