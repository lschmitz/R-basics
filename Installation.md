# Installation

## Step 1
Download and install the R version appropriate for your operating system. Go to this website http://www.r-project.org/ and click on the “CRAN” link in the Download menu on the left. On the next site you will see a list of different servers. You can select the 0-cloud servers (1st option). Select the version appropriate for your system (Linux, Mac, Windows) and install, e.g., if you are a PC user click on "Download R for Windows."

## Step 2
I usually recommend installing a user interface called R Studio (http://www.rstudio.com/ ), in particular for PC users. R Studio comes with an enhanced script editor compared to R for Windows. You can download it here: http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Click on the "Download" icon beneath the "FREE" version and then please choose the installer appropriate for your operating system/platform from the list of "Installers for Supported Platforms."
